### Forecasting using Simple Moving Average (SMA)

### Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to forecast stock prices using the Simple Moving Average (SMA) method and evaluate the accuracy of the forecasts.

### Results:
- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
  - A simple moving average with an order of 4 is calculated for the stock price data.
  - The plot shows the original stock price data along with the SMA line in blue.

- **Random Walk (with Drift) Forecast:**
  - A random walk forecast with drift is generated for the stock price data with a horizon of 500 periods.
  - Accuracy measures are computed for the forecast.

### Interpretation:
**Simple Moving Average (SMA):**
  - The SMA is a smoothing technique used to identify trends in data by averaging past observations.
  - The SMA with an order of 4 provides a smoothed representation of the stock price data, helping to visualize trends more clearly.
  - If the SMA line slopes upwards, it indicates an uptrend, while a downward slope suggests a downtrend.

**Random Walk (with Drift) Forecast:**
  - The random walk model with drift assumes that future values will be equal to the last observed value plus a drift component.
  - The forecasted values follow a path that mimics the historical trend, but with some randomness introduced.
  - Accuracy measures such as Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Error (ME), etc., are computed to evaluate the performance of the forecast.

### Heading:
Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test for Stationarity

### Objective:
The objective of conducting the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test is to assess whether the given stock price data is stationary or not. Stationarity is a desirable property in time series data as it indicates that the statistical properties such as mean and variance do not change over time.

### Results:
- **ADF Test Results:**
  - Test Statistic (Dickey-Fuller): 1.6164
  - Lag Order: 11
  - p-value: 0.99
 
### Interpretation:
- The p-value of 0.99 suggests that the null hypothesis of non-stationarity cannot be rejected at conventional significance levels (e.g., α = 0.05).
- Since the p-value is high and greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests  that the data is  non stationary.

### Managerial Implication:

The ADF test suggests that the daily price of TRENT stock are likely non stationary.

as p value is greater than 0.05

*Since the stock price is not stationery, the stock price data is transformed by taking the log difference of stock price* 


```{r}
#*Since the stock price is not stationery, the stock price data is transformed by taking the log difference of stock price 
# adf test on return as in price it is not stationary
stock_return = na.omit(diff(log(stock_price)));
plot(stock_return)
adf_test_stock_return = adf.test(stock_return);
adf_test_stock_return
```

```{r}

```

### Result:
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stationarity on TRENT.NS daily returns yields the following results: - Dickey-Fuller statistic: -11.293 - Lag order: 11 - p-value: 0.01 - Alternative hypothesis: Stationary

### Implication:
The ADF test suggests that the daily returns of TRENT.NS stock are likely stationary. The small p-value (0.01) indicates evidence against the null hypothesis of non-stationarity. 
Therefore, we have reason to believe that the TRENT stock returns exhibit stationarity, which is important for certain time series analysis.

```
### Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation

### Objective:
The objective of conducting the Ljung-Box test is to assess whether there is significant autocorrelation in the stock return data. Autocorrelation refers to the correlation of a time series with a lagged version of itself, indicating whether previous values influence current values.

### Results:
- **Ljung-Box Test Results:**
  - Test Statistic (X-squared): 4.2319
  - Degrees of Freedom (df): 1
  - p-value: 0.03967
  
### Interpretation:
- The Ljung-Box test statistic value of 4.2319 is compared with critical values to determine the presence of autocorrelation in the data.
- The degrees of freedom indicate the number of lags considered in the test.
- The p-value of 0.03967 is below conventional significance levels (e.g., α = 0.05), suggesting evidence against the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation.
- Since the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis.
- The significant p-value indicates that there is evidence of autocorrelation in the stock return data.

**Therefore, we have reason to believe that the TRENT stock returns exhibit stationarity, which is important for certain time series analyses.**

### Auto ARIMA Model for Stock Returns

### Objective:
The objective of fitting an Auto ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model to the stock return data is to identify a suitable model that captures the underlying patterns and dynamics of the returns.

### Results:
- **Auto ARIMA Model Results:**
  - Model: ARIMA(0,0,1) with non-zero mean
  - Coefficients:
    - Moving Average (MA) term (ma1): 0.0559
    - Mean: 0.0015
  - Standard Errors:
    - ma1: 0.0265
    - mean: 0.0006
  - Variance (sigma^2): 0.0005105
  - Log Likelihood: 3510.2
  - Akaike Information Criterion (AIC): -7014.4
  - Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc): -7014.39
  - Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): -6998.5
  
### Interpretation:
- The Auto ARIMA model is specified as ARIMA(0,0,1), indicating it has a moving average (MA) term of order 1 and zero auto-regressive (AR) and differencing (I) orders.
- The coefficients for the model parameters are estimated as follows:
  - MA term coefficient (ma1): 0.0559
  - Mean: 0.0015
- The standard errors provide measures of uncertainty for the coefficient estimates.
- The variance (sigma^2) of the model residuals is 0.0005105.
- The log likelihood, AIC, AICc, and BIC are statistical measures used for model comparison and selection, with lower values indicating better fit or parsimony.

### Analysis of Residuals from Auto ARIMA Model for Stock Returns

###  Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to examine the properties of the residuals obtained from the Auto ARIMA model fitted to the stock return data. Residuals represent the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.

### Results:
- **Residuals Time Series:**
  - Start: 1
  - End: 6
  - Frequency: 1
  - Residual Values:
    1. -0.014847135
    2. 0.003590639
    3. 0.010093186
    4. 0.050235654
    5. -0.021739264
    6. -0.012865265
    
### Interpretation:
The provided residuals represent the differences between the observed stock returns and the values predicted by the Auto ARIMA model. These residuals are essential indicators of model accuracy. Positive residuals suggest underestimation of returns, while negative residuals indicate overestimation. Close-to-zero residuals imply a good fit between observed and predicted values, whereas larger residuals may signal areas where the model could be improved. Managers should closely monitor residuals to identify opportunities for refining the model and enhancing forecasting accuracy.

# H0 - No Auto-correlation { Favourable }

```

### Objective:
To conduct a Ljung-Box test for autocorrelation on the residuals of the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model.

### Analysis:
Utilized the 'Box.test' function to perform the Ljung-Box test on the residuals of the ARIMA model.

### Results:

Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation on Residuals: - X-squared statistic: 0.0018591 - Degrees of freedom: 1 - p-value: 0.9656

### Interpretation:
The Box-Pierce test assesses the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals of the Auto ARIMA model for stock returns. The test statistic (X-squared) is 0.0018808 with 1 degree of freedom, resulting in a p-value of 0.9654. 

With a high p-value of 0.9654, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation. This suggests that there is no significant autocorrelation present in the residuals of the Auto ARIMA model. Therefore, the residuals appear to be independent over time, indicating that the model adequately captures the underlying patterns in the stock return data.

###Action:
The absence of autocorrelation in residuals suggests that the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model adequately captures the temporal patterns in the time series of TRENT.NS_return. This implies that the model's predictions are reliable and can be used for forecasting future values.\
The lack of autocorrelation in residuals suggests the ARIMA model effectively captures the data patterns, potentially leading to more reliable forecasts for future use by managers.

```

### Objective:
To fit an ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model to the daily returns ('TRENT.NS_return') of TRENT.NS stock and generate forecasts.

### Analysis:
Employed the 'arima' function to fit the ARIMA model and utilized the 'forecast' function to generate forecasts. The results for the ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model are as follows:

### ARIMA Model (0, 0, 1):
Coefficients: - Moving Average (MA): ma1 = 0.0559 - Intercept term: intercept = 0.0015 Standard Errors: - SE for ma1: 0.0265 - SE for intercept: 0.0006 Variance (sigma\^2) estimated as 0.0005098 Log likelihood: 3510.22 AIC: -7014.44

### Forecasting:
Generated forecasts for the next 1000 time points using the fitted ARIMA model.

###Plot:
The plot illustrates the original time series of daily returns alongside the forecasted values.

### Implication:
The ARIMA(0, 0, 1) model is fitted to the historical daily returns of TRENT.NS stock, offering insights into the underlying patterns. The forecasts generated by the model can be utilized for future predictions. The accompanying plot provides a visual representation of the model's performance.

### Analysis of Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity in Residuals

### Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to assess whether there is evidence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the residuals obtained from the Auto ARIMA model fitted to the stock return data. Two tests, the Box Test and the ARCH Test, are conducted for this purpose.

### Results:

#### Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: Box Test
- **Box-Pierce Test Results:**
  - Test Statistic (X-squared): 16.46
  - Degrees of Freedom (df): 1
  - p-value: 4.968e-05
- The p-value obtained from the Box Test is very low, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity.

#### Test for Volatility Clustering or Heteroskedasticity: ARCH Test
- **ARCH Test Results:**
  - Test Statistic (Chi-squared): 8.458
  - Degrees of Freedom (df): 10
  - p-value: 0.5842
- The p-value obtained from the ARCH Test is relatively high, suggesting that there is no significant evidence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects in the squared residuals.

### Interpretation:
- The results of the Box Test indicate strong evidence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the squared residuals. This suggests that the variance of the residuals is not constant over time, indicating that periods of high volatility tend to cluster together.
- However, the results of the ARCH Test do not provide significant evidence of ARCH effects in the squared residuals. This implies that the clustering of volatility may not be driven by autoregressive effects.
- Overall, while there is evidence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the squared residuals according to the Box Test, the ARCH Test does not find significant evidence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity. This suggests that the nature of volatility clustering in the residuals may be different from traditional ARCH effects.

###  Analysis of ARCH Effects in GARCH Residuals

### Objective:
The objective of this analysis is to investigate the presence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects in the residuals obtained from the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model fitted to the squared stock return data.

### Results:
#### ARCH Test Results:
- **Test Statistic (Chi-squared):** 28.356
- **Degrees of Freedom (df):** 20
- **p-value:** 0.1012

### Interpretation:
The ARCH test assesses whether there are significant ARCH effects present in the GARCH residuals. The test statistic (Chi-squared) is 28.356 with 20 degrees of freedom, resulting in a p-value of 0.1012.

- The null hypothesis of the ARCH test is that there are no ARCH effects in the residuals.
- With a p-value of 0.1012, which is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- This indicates that there is no significant evidence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) effects in the GARCH residuals at the specified lags.

Overall, based on the ARCH test results, we do not find significant evidence of volatility clustering or heteroskedasticity in the GARCH residuals at the 0.05 significance level. However, it's important to note that the presence of ARCH effects may vary depending on the chosen lag structure and other factors, so further analysis may be warranted to confirm the stability of the results.

```{r}
#fit the garch model in original data , TRENT.NS_return
